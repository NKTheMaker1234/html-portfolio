<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am someone that wants to work on trying to make something cool for the internet to see and this is the first step to do that</p>

<p>This is a basic HTML Portfolio and here are some of my likes

    <li>Video Games</li>
    <li>YouTube Videos</li>
    <li>Game Design</li>
    <li>Media Analysis</li>
    <li>Cool Art</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>My current progression so far is that I have a good understanding of HTML, a decent hold on CSS and a basic understanding of JavaScript, Node.JS and React</p>
